Debugging noteS:


This is the debug console output so far...

	"BOOT SERIAL
	NVRAM READ
	STARTING DEBUG ENGINE
	STARTED DEBUG ENGINE
	INTERRUPT ATTACHED TO BUTTON 2
	ENTERING SELECT LOOP
	EMULATION CHOSEN
	EXEC MEM CHECK
	Free mem: 6495
	USB"
	
Seems like the stack is full??? or a watchdog timer is set
to reboot???? Setup function must finish before a cetrain time????

	 - Investigate:
	 	- Setup watchdog
	 	- Boot up Watchdog?
	 	- Stack size?
	 	- Stack overflow?
