		-> ROUTER MAIN
			- needs to be implemented.
			- needs to update hidden configs (i.e. router state)
				and the hidden values (i.e. temp...)
				also needs to do network arbitration and network
				topology descovery.
			- needs to act upon thresholds exceeding.
			
		-> SENSOR NETWORK ABSTRACTION
			- LinkID_t association
			
		-> ISR / TIMER.C
			- implement the heartbeat ISR
			- implement the watchdog timer ISR for timeouts
				 - 	set_watchdog(SEC_1);
				 - 	run_watchdog_timer();
					- checks the status variable for a different status
			- implement the network topology descovery ISR (10sec?)
			- implement the system check ISR (5sec?)
				- checks the error states on the system.
				
		-> OTHERS
			- DONE !!! ---- reverse engineer the LinkID for the RFBee - FOUND A WAY TO GO AROUND THIS
			- convert the chronos EP to AP
			- Remove Bluerobin stack.
			- Finish user settings			- Implement precompiler for network options
