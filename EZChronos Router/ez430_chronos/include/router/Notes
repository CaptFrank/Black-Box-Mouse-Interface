		-> UTILITIES:
			- DONE !!
		
		-> CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
			- DONE !!
			
		-> ROUTER NETWORK UTILITIES
			- DONE !!
			
		-> SENSOR NETWORK UTILITIES
			- implement the receiver utilities for the responses.
			- implement timeout.
			
		-> RECEIVER UTILITIES
			- finish the read response function. 
				- implement the logic to store and alert the data.
			- finish the read response state machine.
			
		-> ERROR HANDLER
			- implement the error menu.
		
		-> ROUTER <-> BASE STATION PROTOCOL
			- DONE !!
			
		-> ROUTER <-> SENSOR PROTOCOL
			- 0.5 DONE
				- command interface done.
				- responses need to implemented
				
		-> JOYSTICK MOUSE / MOUSE SELECTION
			- DONE !!
				
		-> PACKET HANDLER
			- the creation and getting of the usb structure
				- needs to be implemented.
			- the abstraction of the network API
				- needs to be implemented
				
		-> ROUTER MAIN
			- needs to be implemented.
			- needs to update hidden configs (i.e. router state)
				and the hidden values (i.e. temp...)
				also needs to do network arbitration and network
				topology descovery.
			- needs to act upon thresholds exceeding.
			- implement scheduler
			
		-> ISR 
			- implement the heartbeat ISR
			- implement the watchdog timer ISR for timeouts
			- implement the network topology descovery ISR (10sec?)
			- implement the system check ISR (5sec?)
				- checks the error states on the system.
				
		-> OTHERS
			- reverse engineer the LinkID for the RFBee
			- convert the chronos EP to AP
			- Remove Bluerobin stack.
