\subsection{Detailed Description}
G\-E\-N\-E\-R\-A\-L I\-N\-F\-O A\-B\-O\-U\-T U\-S\-B D\-E\-V\-I\-C\-E F\-U\-N\-C\-T\-I\-O\-N\-S This is the procedures to gain access to the sensor values on the remote sensors. This document is meant to be a guideline for the future application layer protocol developemnt.

This state is accessed when the Arduino A\-D\-K (Ground station) needs to map out the network at hand. This state requests a status report from the router, and the router sends a report of all sensors available and their ids and data types (includes number of bytes to allocate for the rx buffer).

N\-O\-T\-E\-: The I\-F(\-R\-E\-M\-E\-M\-B\-E\-R) condition is implemented using the D\-B.\-h library found on Arduino.\-com. It uses the E\-E\-P\-R\-O\-M to store information\textbackslash{} about the configuration. \begin{DoxyVerb}#if(ID_REQUEST)


       This function sends_a wakeup call to the router and makes the
       router go into command polling mode. This allows the router to
       only react to the commands sent by the ground station and not the
       sensors.

       -> This function needs an ack before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     1. send_wakeup_router();
            -> receive_router_ack();
            -> ping_router


       This function requests a router status structure. It sends a
       request command and polls until a structure is returned or when a
       watchdog timer exhaust is caught.

       -> This function needs an ack before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     2. request_router_status();
            -> receive_router_status();


       This function is very crucial to the network implementation, as
       it maps out the receiver and sender nodes. This function sends a
       generic "nmap" command, which activates a network_read() command on
       the router. Then in turn, the router returns a network structure,
       which contains enddevice information and other crucial network info.

       -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     3. request_net_map();
            -> receive_nmap();


               This part of the code stores the received network info in
               non-volatile EEPROM for future storage.\

            IF(REMEMBER)
                -> store_into_sensor_db(nmap_t* nmap);
            ENDIF


       Now that the network topology is mapped out, the follwoing command
       is issued to all endpoint devices (sensors) to acquire their
       respective specifics, such as channel IDs, speed and data types.

       -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     4. request_sensor_channel_info();
            -> receive_channel_info();


               This part of the code stores the received network info in
               non-volatile EEPROM for future storage.\

            IF(REMEMBER)
                -> store_into_sensor_db(channel_info_t* channel_info);
            ENDIF


       This function polls for an enabled sensor report generated by the
       user on the router, by slecting which sensor is enabled.

     5. get_user_enable_sensors();
            -> set_flags(byte sensor flags);


       Then to finalize the ground station network initialization,
       we need to allocate buffers for each sensor and then create a
       call priority table, which in other words is a call scheduler.
       This finalizes the network setup on the ground station side.

       -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     6. configure_ground_station();
            -> allocate_buffers(nampe_t* nmap, channel_info_t* channel_info);
            -> create_call_priority_table();
#ENDIF
\end{DoxyVerb}


This state is reached when we have successfully finished the init stage and we are requesting data from the router. \begin{DoxyVerb}#IF(RUN_REQUEST)


       This function checks the sensor states based off the argument passed.
       This function reveives 1 byte from the router that contains the
       bianry equivalent of the states of the sensors
        -> HIGH = ON
        -> LOW  = OFF

       -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
          to continue with the setup process.

     7. check_sensors_state(byte* sensor_flags);
        -> byte receive_sensor_states();
\end{DoxyVerb}


This part is the working loop for the transaction based protocol. It is an I\-N\-F\-I\-N\-I\-T\-E loop that is only disturbed by the U\-S\-E\-R I/\-O on the chronos or an E\-R\-R\-O\-R. \begin{quotation}

\begin{DoxyVerb}               This function sends a wakeup message to the router, which
               in its turn sends a wakeup signal to the remote node
               specified in the agument passed.

               -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
                  to continue with the setup process.

             8. send_sensors_wakeup(byte* sensor_flags);
                -> receive_router_ack();

               This function sends a sensor data request query to the router,
               which then gets a sensor responce structure back. The sequence
               in which this process is done is with the call_priority_table
               defined above. We go through the table and call each sensor
               to get each peice of information.

               This function receives a router ACK structure, and also receives,
               a data point objcet. All of which are processed, and passed to
               the USB HID object, which then is passed to the CPU.

             9. send_sensor_query(call_priority_table_t* table);
                -> receive_router_ack();
                -> receive_data_points();
#ENDIF
\end{DoxyVerb}


This state is reached when either an error occurs on the router side or an error occurs on the remote sensor side. This is a polling interrupt. All systems are stopped when this occurs, or failsafe/debug mode is activated. \begin{DoxyVerb}#IF(ERROR)

       This function presents the interrupt procedure for a remote error.
       First we receive the error message with the cause, and then we reboot
       The erroneous device. We must make sure to dealloc or free() the mem
       used for the device. We must make sure that the device saves its
       configs and loads them after reboot. We must also make sure that the
       device node is then powered up correctly afterwards.

     interrupt_process();
        -> receive_error_msg(); // contains cause.
        -> send_save_configs_msg(byte* device_node);
        -> reboot_erroneous_device(byte* device_node);
        -> check_remote_configs(byte* device_node);
        -> reinsert_into_ntwk(byte* device_node);

#ENDIF  \end{DoxyVerb}
